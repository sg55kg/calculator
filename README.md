First Update(8/19/21):

Starting to lay out the page and figure out the different parts I'll need and where everything should go. I'm sure this one will take awhile. I need to make sure I get all of the buttons I need first and get the layout looking mostly correct, and then I'll start to work on everything in javascript.
