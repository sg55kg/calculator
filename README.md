# calculator

Second Update 8/21:

Got it 95% done!... but it's very easy to break it after one calculation. I'm going to go through and clean everything up so it doesn't have all of these bugs, and then it will be (functionally) done. Then I might go and give it a little more unique color theme in CSS instead of the basic iPhone calculator look that I originally went for.

Update(8/21):

The clear and delete buttons work, and the decimal button now works properly and can only be used once. I attempted to make the '%' button divide the current number by 100 like the iphone calculator, but so far no luck on that. There's still a ways to go, but I could see this getting finished in the next day or two if things go right.

Update(8/20):

Got the cacheDom function working finally, and experimenting with a test function to make sure I can get all of the buttons to do something. Now I'm working on a function to add each number to the result bar, which is challenging. The code is a mess of comments for possible solutions and notes right now, but progress is being made.

Update(8/19):

Got the layout much quicker than I was expecting, just had to google some extra stuff on CSS grid. Now that the calculator looks decent on the outside, I've started to work on the javascript inside.

First Update(8/19/21):

Starting to lay out the page and figure out the different parts I'll need and where everything should go. I'm sure this one will take awhile. I need to make sure I get all of the buttons I need first and get the layout looking mostly correct, and then I'll start to work on everything in javascript.
