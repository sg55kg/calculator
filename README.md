# calculator

Update(8/19):

Got the layout much quicker than I was expecting, just had to google some extra stuff on CSS grid. Now that the calculator looks decent on the outside, I've started to work on the javascript inside.

First Update(8/19/21):

Starting to lay out the page and figure out the different parts I'll need and where everything should go. I'm sure this one will take awhile. I need to make sure I get all of the buttons I need first and get the layout looking mostly correct, and then I'll start to work on everything in javascript.
